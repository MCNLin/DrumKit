### Day 1 Challenge of Javascript30

## Javascript Drum Kit

At the beginning of this challenge, it's just an HTML page that displays letters which corresponds with a key on the keyboard, and the name of the soundclip that should play when pressed. Goal for this challenge is when a user presses a corresponding key on the webpage, the soundclip should play everytime the key is pressed as well as highlight around the button.

### What I learned:
- addEventListener
- querySelector & querySelectorAll
- classList
- transitionend
